# Transcoding to MP4 / h.265 / HEVC

There is no official support for *h265 / HEVC* in *DuME* yet, but it is in development and will be available soon.

That being said, as *DuME* relies on *FFmpeg* for the encoding, you can already adjust *h265* encoding using custom parameters. Read the [*FFmpeg* wiki about *h265*](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/H.265) for more details about these parameters.
