# Install DuME on Windows

!!! note
    For now, DuME on Windows is only availabe in 64bit and will not work on 32bit systems (unless you build it from source by yourself).

**You can [download DuME here](https://rainboxlab.org/tools/dume/).**

!!! note
    For now, only a zip archive is available and there is no installer provided. DuME is a portable application and you can just unzip the files on a flash drive if you'd like to keep it with you.

## ZIP Archive

You can download the `.zip` archive and just unzip **all** the files on your computer. Double click on DuME.exe to launch the application, or create a shortcut.

## Build from source

You can [get the source code on Github](https://github.com/Rainbox-dev/DuME), and easily build DuME using Qt and the Qt Creator.

You'll also need to [download and install FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows).
